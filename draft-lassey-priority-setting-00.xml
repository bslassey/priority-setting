    <abstract>
      <t>HTTP/2 provides a prioritization scheme but experience has shown that implementation support varies.  This document defines an HTTP/2 setting that endpoints can use as an affirmative signal to indicate their support for HTTP/2 Priorities.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The HTTP/2 specification defines a priority scheme in  <xref target="RFC7540"/>, Section 5.3, which some implementers have opted not to fully support. The lack of signalling about the status of the implementation has encouraged some servers to use heuristics in order to detect when the clients they are connected to do not support priorities as defined and take steps to compensate for that. The intent of this draft is to provide and affirmative signalling mechanism for each client to communicate whether or not it supports and will use the priority scheme as defined in  <xref target="RFC7540"/>, Section 5.3.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in all
      capitals, as shown here.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="parameter" title="The SETTINGS_ENABLE_HTTP2_PRIORITIES SETTINGS Parameter">
      <t>This document adds a new SETTINGS parameter to those defined by
      <xref target="RFC7540"/>, Section 6.5.2.</t>
      <t>The new parameter name is SETTINGS_ENABLE_HTTP2_PRIORITIES. The value of the paramater is a bitmask representing the prioritiy schemes that the peer supports. At this time two values are defined, 0x0 which represents not supporting any priority schemes and 0x1, which represents support for priorities as defined in <xref target="RFC7540"/>. Other values may be defined later.</t>
      <t>If both peers send values for this setting, they MUST each bitwise AND the two values, which then reveals the intersection of the supported schemes between the two. If the result of that bitwise AND is zero, clients SHOULD NOT send priority frames and servers SHOULD NOT make any assumptions based on the presence or lack thereof of priority frames. If the value is non-zero, the highest order bit that is set to 1 will represent the negotiated priority scheme. If a client or server does not send the setting, the peer SHOULD NOT make any assumptions about its support for HTTP/2 priorities.</t>

<abstract><t>This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), referred to as HTTP version 2 (HTTP/2).  HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection.  It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients.</t><t>This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax.  HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.</t></abstract>
